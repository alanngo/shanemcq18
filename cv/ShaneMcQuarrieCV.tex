\section{Research Interests} % ================================================

My current research focuses primarily on methods for data-driven parametric model reduction, but I am interested in many areas of applied mathematics and scientific machine learning, including inverse problems, data assimilation, (numerical) partial differential equations, (numerical) linear algebra, Bayesian inference, and optimization.
% I have worked on applications for rocket combustion, additive manufacturing, convection models, and plasma torches.
I am also interested in education for applied mathematics and computational science.
