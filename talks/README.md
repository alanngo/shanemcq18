Slides and code accompanying presentations given in research talks, class projects, and so on.

- [**2020-09-08-MORSS20-RegOpInf**](./2020-09-08-MORSS20-RegOpInf.pdf): a poster accompanying the paper [_Data-driven reduced-order models via regularized operator inference for a single-injector combustion process_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02862), presented at the [Model Order Reduction Summer School 2020](https://morss2020.epfl.ch/) hosted by [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/).

- [**2019-12-10-CSE392-Reprojection**](./2019-12-10-CSE392-Reprojection.pdf): an overview of the paper [_Sampling low-dimensional Markovian dynamics for pre-asymptotically recovering reduced models from data with operator inference_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11233), written as a final project for a class on scientific computational machine / deep learning at [the Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/).

- [**2019-11-21-CSE392-ParametricROM**](./2019-11-21-CSE392-ParametricROM.ipynb): code demonstrating parametric model reduction via intrusive projection, as part of a joint presentation with Xueying Lu and Saba Baig reviewing the paper [_A Survey of Projection-Based Model Reduction Methods for Parametric Dynamical Systems_](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/130932715). Presented in a class on scientific computational machine / deep learning at [the Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/).

- [**2019-11-15-CSE392-DiffusionMaps**](./2019-11-15-CSE392-DiffusionMaps.pdf): an overview of the paper [_Diffusion maps, spectral clustering and reaction coordinates of dynamical systems_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063520306000534), presented in a class on scientific computational machine / deep learning at [the Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/).

- [**2019-10-25-BlitzForum-MORviaPOD**](./2019-10-25-BlitzForum-MORviaPOD.pdf): a very gentle introduction to model order reduction via proper orthogonal decomposition, given in a student research forum at [the Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/).

- [**2018-07-01-BYUMSThesis-RBDA.pdf**](./2018-07-01-BYUMSThesis-RBDA.pdf): slides for my thesis, [_Data Assimilation in the Boussinesq Approximation for Mantle Convection_](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/6951/), fulfilling the requirements for an M.S. in mathematics at [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/). Much of the work in this thesis evolved into the paper [_Data Assimilation in Large-Prandtl Rayleigh-BÃ©nard Convection from Thermal Measurements_](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/19M1248327), published in the SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems.
