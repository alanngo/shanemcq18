Recent talks are listed first.

- [**2019-12-10-CSE392-Reprojection**](/talks/2019-12-10-CSE392-Reprojection.pdf): an overview of the paper [_Sampling low-dimensional Markovian dynamics for pre-asymptotically recovering reduced models from data with operator inference_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11233), presented as a final project for a class on scientific computational machine / deep learning at [the Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/).

- [**2019-11-21-CSE392-ParametricROM**](/talks/2019-11-21-CSE392-ParametricROM.ipynb): code demonstrating parametric model reduction via intrusive projection, as part of a joint presentation with Xueying Lu and Saba Baig reviewing the paper [_A Survey of Projection-Based Model Reduction Methods for Parametric Dynamical Systems_](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/130932715). Presented in a class on scientific computational machine / deep learning at [the Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/).

- [**2019-11-15-CSE392-DiffusionMaps**](/talks/2019-11-15-CSE392-DiffusionMaps.pdf): an overview of the paper [_Diffusion maps, spectral clustering and reaction coordinates of dynamical systems_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063520306000534), presented in a class on scientific computational machine / deep learning at [the Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/).

- [**2019-10-25-BlitzForum-MORviaPOD**](/talks/2019-10-25-BlitzForum-MORviaPOD.pdf): a very gentle introduction to model order reduction via proper orthogonal decomposition, given in a student research forum at [the Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/).

- [**2018-07-01-BYUMS-RBDA_Thesis**](/talks/2018-07-01-BYU_MS-RBDA_Thesis.pdf): slides for my thesis, [_Data Assimilation in the Boussinesq Approximation for Mantle Convection_](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/6951/), fulfilling the requirements for an M.S. in mathematics at [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/). Much of the work in this thesis evolved into the paper [_Data Assimilation in Large-Prandtl Rayleigh-BÃ©nard Convection from Thermal Measurements_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01508), which has been accepted by the SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems.
