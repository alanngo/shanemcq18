This repository hosts some projects that I've worked on in school, at BYU (undergraduate and masters) and UT Austin (Ph.D.).

- `DataStructures`: some classical data structures, implemented in Python.
- `MarkovChains`: the script `markov_chains.py` has tools for simulating bad English using simple Markov Chains.
