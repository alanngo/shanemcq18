### About Me

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/" target="\_blank">Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences</a> (ICES) at the University of Texas at Austin.
I've just started working with <a href="http://kiwi.ices.utexas.edu/" target="\_blank">Dr. Karen Willcox</a> in the new DOE-funded <a href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/about/news/527/" target="\blank">AEOLUS</a> center.
In 2018 I graduated from Brigham Young University (BYU) with a M.S. in mathematics; in 2016 I earned a B.S. in applied and computational mathematics, also from BYU.

My wife Laura and I live in Austin with our two young boys.
I love jazz, ultimate frisbee, and mint chocolate ice cream.
They love Disney movies, playing ball, and basically any kind of ice cream.
Laura has a B.S. in statistics from BYU and worked for a few years on the logistics engineering team for Wynright Corporation in Salt Lake City.
We were married in 2015.

### Research

I'm currently working with Dr. Karen Willcox at ICES on problems related to reduced order modeling and phase field models, with applications to advanced manufacturing and materials.
I am also interested in numerical methods for PDEs, numerical analysis, data assimilation, inverse problems, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning.

At BYU, I worked with Dr. Jared Whitehead on several projects related to data assimilation, mantle convection, and optimal transport.
My masters thesis, <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/6951/" target="\_blank">Data Assimilation in the Boussinesq Approximation for Mantle Convection</a>, was a springboard for an upcoming journal publication.

My first exposure to formal mathematical research was at BYU with <a href="http://users.monash.edu/~jpurcell" target="\_blank">Dr. Jessica Purcell</a>, who has since moved to Monash University in Australia.
Dr. Purcell specializes in hyperbolic knot theory, so the project I worked on involved some very interesting combinatorial proofs, topological ideas, and fun pictures.
See <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218216515500443" target="\_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0195.pdf" target="\_blank">the ArXiv</a> for our publication.

### Foundations of Applied Mathematics

As an undergraduate and masters student at BYU, I helped pioneer the applied and computational mathematics emphasis (ACME) in the math department.
The program emphasizes connecting solid theoretical mathematics with scientific computing in Python.
<!-- The goal of the program is to serve as a template for a new, modern curriculum for applied mathematics. -->
The curriculum is split into four courses: mathematical analysis; algorithms, approximation, and optimization; modeling with uncertainty and data; and modeling with dynamics and control.
Each course has a lecture class and an accompanying lab section.
While the professors have been writing <a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/ot152/" target="\_blank">the textbooks</a> for the lecture classes, students have been primarily responsible for writing and editing the lab curriculum.
Over the past several years I have had a hand in writing, editing, or planning about half of the 90 or so labs, some completely from scratch.
I also managed the student development team for the labs, designed an automated test driver system, administered our git repository, wrote contributing documentation, set up a website for deployment, and taught the lab courses for algorithms, approximation, and optimization, and modeling with uncertainty and data.

The lab manuals are available at <a href="https://foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io/" target="\_blank">foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io</a>.
I especially like the labs on Facial Recognition (Volume 1), the PageRank Algorithm (Volume 1), and Markov Chains (Volume 2).

### Class Projects

Most of my favorite math classes have focused on numerical analysis, partial differential equations, or statistical machine learning.
The following are a few projects that I completed as part of these courses.
- [Acoustic Scattering](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/acoustic_scattering.pdf): a finite difference approach to solving a wave scattering problem with an artificial boundary condition to reduce reflective noise.
- [Laminar Flow](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/laminar_flow.pdf): an application of the ADI algorithm (a predictor-corrector method) to solving a PDE modeling pressure-driven laminar flow in two dimensions.
- [Grid Generation](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/grid_generation.pdf): a comparison of the Amsden-Hirt and Winslow algorithms for generating smooth grid domains over nontraditional domains.
- [A Modified Lorenz System](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/lorenz_stability.html): a stability/conditioning analysis of a five-dimensional modification of the famous Lorenz system.
This project was written as a Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebook).

- [HMMs for Collaborative Works](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/hmm_nlp.pdf): a machine learning experiment using parts of speech, hidden Markov models, and a little bit of nearest-neighbor voting to assign each sentence in a document to one of several potential authors.
