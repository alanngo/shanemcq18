### About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/" target="\_blank">Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences</a> (formerly ICES) at the University of Texas at Austin.
I work with <a href="http://kiwi.oden.utexas.edu/" target="\_blank">Dr. Karen Willcox</a> in the new DOE-funded <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/about/news/527/" target="\blank">AEOLUS</a> center.
In 2018 I graduated from Brigham Young University (BYU) with a M.S. in mathematics; in 2016 I earned a B.S. in applied and computational mathematics, also from BYU.

My wife Laura and I live in Austin with our two young boys.
I love jazz, ultimate frisbee, and mint chocolate ice cream.
They love Disney movies, playing ball, and basically any kind of ice cream.
Laura has a B.S. in statistics from BYU and worked for a few years on the logistics engineering team for Wynright Corporation in Salt Lake City.
We were married in 2015.

### Research Interests

My current research focuses primarily on methods for data-driven parametric model reduction, with applications for plasma physics, additive manufacturing, and rocket combustion.
I am interested in many areas of applied mathematics and scientific machine learning, including inverse problems, data assimilation, (numerical) partial differential equations, (numerical) linear algebra, Bayesian inference, and optimization, as well as education for applied mathematics and computational science.

At BYU, I worked with Dr. Jared Whitehead on several projects related to data assimilation, mantle convection, and optimal transport.
My masters thesis, <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/6951/" target="\_blank">Data Assimilation in the Boussinesq Approximation for Mantle Convection</a>, was a springboard for the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01508/" target="\_blank">Data Assimilation in Large-Prandtl Rayleigh-BÃ©nard Convection from Thermal Measurements</a>.

My first exposure to formal mathematical research was at BYU with <a href="http://users.monash.edu/~jpurcell" target="\_blank">Dr. Jessica Purcell</a>, who has since moved to Monash University in Australia.
Dr. Purcell specializes in hyperbolic knot theory, so the project I worked on involved some very interesting combinatorial proofs, topological ideas, and fun pictures.
See <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218216515500443" target="\_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0195.pdf" target="\_blank">the ArXiv</a> for our publication.

### Foundations of Applied Mathematics

As an undergraduate and masters student at BYU, I helped pioneer the applied and computational mathematics emphasis (ACME) in the math department.
The program emphasizes connecting solid theoretical mathematics with scientific computing in Python.
<!-- The goal of the program is to serve as a template for a new, modern curriculum for applied mathematics. -->
The curriculum is split into four courses: mathematical analysis; algorithms, approximation, and optimization; modeling with uncertainty and data; and modeling with dynamics and control.
Each course has a lecture class and an accompanying lab section.
While the professors have been writing <a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/ot152/" target="\_blank">the textbooks</a> for the lecture classes, students have been primarily responsible for writing and editing the lab curriculum.
Over the past several years I have had a hand in writing, editing, or planning about half of the 90 or so labs, some completely from scratch.
I also managed the student development team for the labs, designed an automated test driver system, administered our git repository, wrote contributing documentation, set up a website for deployment, and taught the lab courses for algorithms, approximation, and optimization, and modeling with uncertainty and data.

The lab manuals are available at <a href="https://foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io/" target="\_blank">foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io</a>.
I especially like the labs on Facial Recognition (Volume 1), the PageRank Algorithm (Volume 1), and Markov Chains (Volume 2).

### Class Projects

Most of my favorite classes have focused on numerical analysis, partial differential equations, or statistical machine learning.
The following are a few projects that I completed as part of these courses.
- [Acoustic Scattering](https://github.com/shanemcq18/shanemcq18/raw/master/projects/acoustic_scattering.pdf): a finite difference approach to solving a wave scattering problem with an artificial boundary condition to reduce reflective noise.
- [Laminar Flow](https://github.com/shanemcq18/shanemcq18/raw/master/projects/laminar_flow.pdf): an application of the ADI algorithm (a predictor-corrector method) to solving a PDE modeling pressure-driven laminar flow in two dimensions.
- [Grid Generation](https://github.com/shanemcq18/shanemcq18/raw/master/projects/grid_generation.pdf): a comparison of the Amsden-Hirt and Winslow algorithms for generating smooth grid domains over nontraditional domains.
- [A Modified Lorenz System](https://github.com/shanemcq18/shanemcq18/raw/master/projects/lorenz_stability.html): a stability/conditioning analysis of a five-dimensional modification of the famous Lorenz system.
This project was written as a Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebook).

- [HMMs for Collaborative Works](https://github.com/shanemcq18/shanemcq18/raw/master/projects/hmm_nlp.pdf): a machine learning experiment using parts of speech, hidden Markov models, and a little bit of nearest-neighbor voting to assign each sentence in a document to one of several potential authors.
