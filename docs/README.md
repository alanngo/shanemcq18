# 1. Biography

I grew up in Provo just a few miles from BYU campus.
I've also lived in Chicago and Albuquerque, have visited ten countries, and am fluent in English and Spanish.
Besides mathematics, I also love music: I've played the trumpet for over a decade and am a big fan of classical music and jazz.
My favorite sport is ultimate frisbee, which is uncommonly popular in Utah.

I helped pioneer a new applied and computational mathematics emphasis (ACME) at BYU, a program that emphasizes connecting solid theoretical mathematics with scientific computing in Python (see below).
As a graduate student, my research interests have included numerical methods for PDEs, numerical analysis, data assimilation, stochastic dynamical systems, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning.

My wife Laura earned a BS in Statistics from BYU and worked for a few years on the logistics engineering team for Wynright Corporation in Salt Lake City.
We were married in mid 2015, just before I started my senior year at BYU.
A year an a half later, the day after the last day of my first semester as a graduate student, we welcomed our son Andrew into the family.
He enjoys hitting pots with a wooden spoon, playing hide and seek, and watching his mom make dinner.

# 2. Projects

#### Foundations of Applied Mathematics

The new applied and computational mathematics emphasis in BYU's math department was designed as a template for a new, modern curriculum for applied mathematics.
The curriculum is split into four courses: mathematical analysis; algorithms, approximation, and optimization; modeling with uncertainty and data; and modeling with dynamics and control.
Each course has a lecture class and an accompanying lab section.
While the professors have been writing the textbooks for the lecture classes (the first textbook in the _Foundations of Applied Mathematics_ series is published and available <a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/ot152/" target="\_blank">from SIAM</a>), students have been primarily responsible for writing and editing the lab curriculum.
Over the past several years I have had a hand in writing, editing, or planning about half of the 90 or so labs, some completely from scratch.
I currently manage the student development team for the labs and teach the course for modeling with uncertainty and data.

The following are some examples of labs that I have written or heavily edited.
- [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/PythonIntro.pdf)
- [Introduction to NumPy](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/NumpyIntro.pdf)
- [The QR Decomposition](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/QR_Decomposition.pdf)
- [Iterative Solvers](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/IterativeSolvers.pdf)
- [Markov Chains](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/MarkovChains.pdf)

#### Knot Theory

My first exposure to formal mathematical research was at BYU with <a href="http://users.monash.edu/~jpurcell" target="\_blank">Dr. Jessica Purcell</a>, who has since moved to Monash University in Australia.
Dr. Purcell specializes in hyperbolic knot theory, so the project I worked on involved some very interesting combinatorial proofs, topological ideas, and fun pictures.
See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0195.pdf" target="\_blank">here</a> for our publication.
