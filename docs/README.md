# 1. Biography

I grew up in Provo just a few miles from BYU campus.
I've also lived in Chicago and Albuquerque, have visited ten countries, and am fluent in English and Spanish.
Besides mathematics, I also love music: I've played the trumpet for over a decade and am a big fan of classical music and jazz.
My favorite sport is ultimate frisbee, which is uncommonly popular in Utah.

As an undergraduate and masters student at Brigham Young University (BYU), I helped pioneer a new applied and computational mathematics emphasis (ACME), a program that emphasizes connecting solid theoretical mathematics with scientific computing in Python (see below).
I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Univeristy of Texas, Austin, in the Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics program (CSEM) at the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES).
My research interests include numerical methods for PDEs, numerical analysis, data assimilation, inverse problems, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning.

My wife Laura earned a BS in Statistics from BYU and worked for a few years on the logistics engineering team for Wynright Corporation in Salt Lake City.
We were married in mid 2015, just before I started my senior year at BYU.
A year an a half later, just after my first set of final exams as a masters student, we welcomed our son Andrew into the family.
He enjoys hitting pots with a wooden spoon, playing hide and seek, and watching his mom make dinner.
We are expecting a second son this November.

# 2. Projects

#### Foundations of Applied Mathematics

The new applied and computational mathematics emphasis in BYU's math department was designed as a template for a new, modern curriculum for applied mathematics.
The curriculum is split into four courses: mathematical analysis; algorithms, approximation, and optimization; modeling with uncertainty and data; and modeling with dynamics and control.
Each course has a lecture class and an accompanying lab section.
While the professors have been writing the textbooks for the lecture classes (the first textbook in the _Foundations of Applied Mathematics_ series is published and available <a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/ot152/" target="\_blank">from SIAM</a>), students have been primarily responsible for writing and editing the lab curriculum.
Over the past several years I have had a hand in writing, editing, or planning about half of the 90 or so labs, some completely from scratch.
I currently manage the student development team for the labs and teach the course for modeling with uncertainty and data.

The following are some examples of labs that I have written or heavily edited.
- [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/PythonIntro.pdf)
- [Introduction to NumPy](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/NumpyIntro.pdf)
- [The QR Decomposition](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/QR_Decomposition.pdf)
- [Iterative Solvers](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/IterativeSolvers.pdf)
- [Markov Chains](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/MarkovChains.pdf)

#### Class Projects

Most of my favorite math classes have focused on numerical analysis, partial differential equations, or statistical machine learning.
The following are a few projects that I completed as part of these courses.
- [Acoustic Scattering](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/acoustic_scattering.pdf): a finite difference approach to a solving wave scattering problem with an artificial boundary condition to reduce reflective noise.
- [Laminar Flow](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/laminar_flow.pdf): an application of the ADI algorithm (a predictor-corrector method) to solving a PDE modeling pressure-driven laminar flow in two dimensions.
- [Grid Generation](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/grid_generation.pdf): a comparison of the Amsden-Hirt and Winslow algorithms for generating smooth grid domains over nontraditional domains.
- [A Modified Lorenz System](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/lorenz_stability.html): a stability/conditioning analysis of a five-dimensional modification of the famous Lorenz system.
This was written as a Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebook).

- [HMMs for Collaborative Works](https://github.com/shanemcq18/Portfolio/raw/master/docs/hmm_nlp.pdf): a machine learning experiment using parts of speech, hidden Markov models, and a little bit of nearest-neighbor voting to assign each sentence in a document to one of several potential authors.

#### Knot Theory

My first exposure to formal mathematical research was at BYU with <a href="http://users.monash.edu/~jpurcell" target="\_blank">Dr. Jessica Purcell</a>, who has since moved to Monash University in Australia.
Dr. Purcell specializes in hyperbolic knot theory, so the project I worked on involved some very interesting combinatorial proofs, topological ideas, and fun pictures.
See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0195.pdf" target="\_blank">here</a> for our publication.
